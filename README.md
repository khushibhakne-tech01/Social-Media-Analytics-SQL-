# Social Media Analytics SQL Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing social media platform data using SQL. A relational database was designed to store information about users, posts, comments, likes, and follower relationships. SQL queries were used to extract meaningful insights related to user activity and engagement patterns.

The project demonstrates practical use of database design concepts and analytical SQL queries to solve real-world business problems related to social media analytics.

## Database Structure
The database consists of the following tables:

- **Users** – Stores user profile information.
- **Posts** – Contains details about posts created by users.
- **Comments** – Stores comments made on posts.
- **Likes** – Tracks likes given by users to posts.
- **Follows** – Represents follower-following relationships between users.

Primary keys and foreign keys are used to maintain relational integrity between tables.

- Measured average likes per post  
- Identified the most active users based on posts, comments, and likes  
- Found posts with the highest engagement  
- Detected inactive users who have not created any posts  
- Analyzed follower growth patterns per user  
- Identified mutual follow relationships between users
